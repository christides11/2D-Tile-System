# 2D-Tile-System
[![donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/-donate-blue.svg)](paypal.me/ChrisTides11)  

A tile-based system made for finite 2D worlds, such as those seen in Terraria and Starbound. 

This project currently uses Unity **2018.3.8f1**, but would probably work on lower versions.

If you find any issues, feel free to create a pull request/issue and I'll look into it.
